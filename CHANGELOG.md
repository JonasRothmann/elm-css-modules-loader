# Release History: elm-css-modules-loader

## 2.0.x

### 2.0.2

🐛 Bug fix: in 2.0.1 CSS filenames that had an underscore in them were silently
skipped. This is now fixed.

### 2.0.1

👍 Performance improvement: no longer use Babel to tranform source code, rather
use a simple regex. This offers a significant speed improvement. On the example
project it reduces build time from ~2000ms to 900ms. On larger projects we've
seen improvements of 5s on the initial build, and 2s on dev-server rebuilds.

### 2.0.0

✨ **New API!** Use the `CssModules.css` function to reference your stylesheet,
and get back a set of helper functions for referencing the classes it contains.
You no longer need to pass the CSS module around. See README.md for examples.

💔 `CssModules.CssModule` type is no longer exposed.

💔 `CssModules.class`, `classList` and `toString` functions are no longer
exposed.

💔 `tagger` configuration option for Webpack loader should now point to the
`css` function, not the `CssModule` constructor. The default has been changed
accordingly, so this should require no change for configurations that use the
default value.

## 1.1.x

### 1.1.2

👍 Add support for Webpack 2 and 3. Webpack 1 is still supported.
